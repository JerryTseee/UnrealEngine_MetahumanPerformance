# UnrealEngine_UIvision
using UI vision RPA to achieve the automation of the animator performance part in Unreal Engine  
  
UI vision RPA is a plugin on Google that can be used for automation of computer  
  
1. The json file is the commands flow of the UI vision RPA
2. The UI vision RPA needs to set up by following the commands
3. CPU usage powershell script is used to detect the CPU usage situation (if CPU usage > certain range: return FALSE; Else: return TRUE)
4. Run the macro on the UI vision RPA to automate the process

!!!The above method is not robust since it use the second platform!!!  
!!!So the UE metahuman peformance can also be achieved by using the python script: UE_MetahumanPerformance.py !!!
